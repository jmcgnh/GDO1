electric-imp-based garage door sensor/controller

This repo contains code related to a garage door controller based on a design and code from Aaron at

http://secretsciencelab.com/diy-electric-imp-wifi-garage-opener-sensor-for-under-50-weekend-project/

There is code that runs on the imp device, code that runs on the imp server and, I hope, code for a web app that you can easily access with your cell phone's browser.

See this project's Wiki for more documentation.
